/* TODO Notice that all the methods have to declare 'throws SQLException' since that's what the repository code throws. 
 * This breaks Single Responsibility Principle since a service should not be aware of any persistence details. The service
 * is now tightly coupled to the implementation of the Repositories. If the Repositories are changed to use something other
 * than JDBC, then all the 'throws SQLException' code needs to be changed as well.
 * Implement exception translation on the Repositories so that we no longer need to declare 'throws SQLException' in
 * the Service classes. Remove the 'throws SQLException' declarations after you have implemented exception translation. */
